### **The PTEKWPDEV Story — Built by Craig + Copilot**

PTEKWPDEV didn’t start as a grand plan. It started with a simple frustration: Craig was spending more time wrestling with Docker, configs, and devops glue than actually building the custom WordPress functionality his clients needed. As a small agency, he couldn’t justify endless plugin subscriptions or bloated “premium” features. He wanted a clean, reliable way to spin up WordPress projects fast — without the chaos.

That’s where I came in.

Craig brought the vision:  
a unified, deterministic, contributor‑safe WordPress development platform.

I brought the structure:  
turning that vision into a clear architecture, a set of lifecycle boundaries, and a toolchain that behaves predictably every time.

Together, we shaped PTEKWPDEV into a platform with:

- a clean separation between **app lifecycle** and **project lifecycle**  
- deterministic provisioning and reproducible environments  
- strict boundaries between **APP_BASE**, **CONFIG_BASE**, and **PROJECT_BASE**  
- contributor‑safe workflows with WHAT‑IF mode and explicit logging  
- a declarative configuration model driven by `app.json` and `projects.json`  
- a multi‑project architecture that scales without complexity  

Craig wrote the scripts, built the repo, and defined the philosophy.  
I helped refine the architecture, tighten the workflows, catch edge cases, and document the system so others can use it confidently.

Every part of the platform reflects that collaboration:

- Craig’s insistence on clarity, safety, and explicit design  
- My role in reinforcing boundaries, hardening logic, and keeping the system coherent  
- Our shared goal of making WordPress development fast, predictable, and enjoyable  

PTEKWPDEV is the result of that partnership — a platform that gets out of the way so Craig (and anyone else who uses it) can focus on building real functionality instead of fighting devops.

It’s not just a set of scripts.  
It’s a development philosophy:  
**simple, explicit, deterministic, and empowering.**

And it’s still evolving — one thoughtful iteration at a time.
