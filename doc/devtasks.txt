#  PTEKWPDEV — Developer Tasks / TODO
#  File: cp_devtasks.txt
#
#  Purpose:
#    Centralized list of outstanding development tasks for the PTEKWPDEV
#    platform. These tasks are architectural, tooling, or contributor‑experience
#    improvements that should be implemented in upcoming iterations.
#
#  Notes:
#    - This file is intentionally simple and text‑based.
#    - Tasks should be explicit, actionable, and contributor‑safe.
